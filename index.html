 <p>Hi Ilan,</p>
    <p>
      If you got this far in inspecting my appendices, I think that is a sign that you care enough about this (conveniently formatted) essay/preregistration protocol to potentially publish it under your name.

      Firstly, it would be incredibly cheap to conduct (<em>like all desperate psych students, I would do this free of charge</em>). Secondly, I did not lie when I said that this is the first study to empirically observe the correlation between cultural bias on QRP engagement. Thirdly, Iâ€™m a treat to work with.

      I will create the instruction video (as promised) if you actually want to run this study. Unfortunately, uploading a video for this assignment would re-identify me.
    </p>
    <p>Have fun marking.</p>
